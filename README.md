# Customer Segmentation
#UnsupervisedLearning #Clustering

### Background
AllLife Bank wants to focus on its credit card customer base in the next financial year. They have been advised by their Marketing Research Team, that the penetration 
in the market can be improved. Based on this input, the Marketing Team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers. 
Another insight from the market research was that the customers perceive the support services of the Bank poorly. Based on this, the Operations team wants to upgrade the 
service delivery model, to ensure that customer queries are resolved faster. Head of Marketing and Head of Delivery both decide to reach out to the Data Science team for help. 

### Objective
- To identify different segments in the existing customer base, based on their spending patterns, as well as past interaction with the bank using clustering algorithms
- How each cluster is different from the others?
- Provide recommendations to the bank on how to better market to and service these customers.
